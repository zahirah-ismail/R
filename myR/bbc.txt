Manchester United have made a Â£28.6m bid for Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos.
The Red Devils believe the 29-year-old wants to leave Real after they failed to offer him an extension to his contract, which expires in 2017.
The Spain international has made 445 appearances for the Bernabeu club.
United manager Louis van Gaal wants defensive reinforcements to help his team improve on last season's fourth-place Premier League finish.
Ramos joined Real from Sevilla in 2005 and scored their injury-time equaliser in their Champions League final victory over Atletico Madrid in 2014.
He has 128 Spain caps and was in the starting line-up as they won Euro 2008, Euro 2012 and the 2010 World Cup.
